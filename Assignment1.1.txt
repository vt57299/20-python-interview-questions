1.What is a data type in Python?
ans. A data type is a classification of data that specifies the type of value that a variable can hold in Python.

2.What are the different data types in Python?
ans. The different data types in Python are integer, float, string, boolean, list, tuple, dictionary, and set.

3.What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
ans. A list is mutable, meaning that it can be changed after creation, whereas a tuple is immutable and cannot be changed after creation.

4.How can you convert a string to a number in Python?
ans. You can convert a string to a number in Python using the int() or float() function.

5.What is an operator in Python?
ans. An operator is a symbol or a set of symbols that performs an operation on one or more operands.

6.What are the different types of operators in Python?
ans. The different types of operators in Python are arithmetic, comparison, logical, assignment, bitwise, and membership operators.

7.How do you concatenate strings in Python?
ans. You can concatenate strings in Python using the '+' operator.

8. What is the difference between '==' and 'is' operators in Python?
ans. The '==' operator checks if two objects have the same value, while the 'is' operator checks if two objects have the same identity.

9.What are conditional statements in Python?
ans. Conditional statements are used to execute a block of code based on whether a particular condition is true or false.

10.What are the different types of conditional statements in Python?
ans. The different types of conditional statements in Python are if, if-else, if-elif-else, and nested if statements.

11.How do you use the 'if' statement in Python?
ans. The 'if' statement in Python is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true. It has the following syntax: if condition: statement(s)

12. How do you use the 'else' statement in Python?
ans. The 'else' statement in Python is used to execute a block of code if the 'if' condition is false. It has the following syntax: else: statement(s)

13. How do you use the 'elif' statement in Python?
ans. The 'elif' statement in Python is used to check for multiple conditions. It has the following syntax: if condition1: statement(s) elif condition2: statement(s) else: statement(s)

14.What is a loop in Python?
ans. A loop in Python is used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.

15. What are the different types of loops in Python?
ans. The different types of loops in Python are the 'for' loop and the 'while' loop.

16. How do you use the 'for' loop in Python?
ans. The 'for' loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence of elements. It has the following syntax: for variable in sequence: statement(s)

17. How do you use the 'while' loop in Python?
ans. The 'while' loop in Python is used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a condition is true. It has the following syntax: while condition: statement(s)

18.What is a function in Python?
ans. A function in Python is a block of code that performs a specific task and can be called from other parts of the program.

19. What are the advantages of using functions in Python?
ans. The advantages of using functions in Python are that they help to improve code organization, reduce code redundancy, and make the code easier to understand.

20.How do you define a function in python?
ans. We define a function using "def" keyword followed by the function name and then parameters.
